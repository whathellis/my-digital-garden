October will see the ImagineFX Art Challenge take on a new format, as we're setting you a list of daily prompts to test out your creative skills.
Each day we'd like you to paint or draw an image based on the prompts provided below. We'll pick our favourite entry from each day and showcase 31 artists in an upcoming issue.
Big news for ImagineFX Art Challenge 6! We're going to run our first month-long prompt list throughout October.  
  
Each day we'd like you to paint or draw an image based on the prompts provided. We'll pick our favourite entry from each day and showcase 31 artists in an upcoming issue.  
  
How to enter: To submit your entry, simply hashtag your artwork with [IFXOctober](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/ifxoctober/?hl=en) and tag our account on Cara, Facebook, Instagram, X/Twitter or Threads by 31 October 2024,11:59pm (GMT +0:00).  
  
AI will not be allowed in our Art Challenge and should not be used at any stage of the artwork process. You will need to provide three process images so that when we contact those being featured in the magazine, we can verify that AI has not been used. Artists that have used AI will not be picked to feature in the magazine.  
  
You can read the terms and conditions via our bio link.
