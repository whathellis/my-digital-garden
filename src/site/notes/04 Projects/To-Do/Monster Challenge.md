### Overview

Our first Monster Challenge requires you to delve deep into the dark, look inside the closet, and into the shadows to come up with an amazing monster.

Monster Challenge has 2 categories: **3D Concept Art** and **2D Concept Art**. It’s a great opportunity for artists looking to challenge themselves and create something epic for their portfolio.

Each category has a Production based brief provided by a ‘Director’. It’s one skill to create great artwork, but it’s another to truly read and execute a brief perfectly, so read carefully before you jump in.
