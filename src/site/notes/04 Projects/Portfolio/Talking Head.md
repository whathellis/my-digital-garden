Hi.
So, recently I've been watching a lot of 3D YouTubers. Like almost every channel from this guy's video, (check it out, he is very cool too).
And I thought, it would be cool to try something like this, and I also wanted to try mouth animation and lip-syncing. But I had a problem, which you actually can hear right now.
I just can't speak.
I was trying to record an audio for this animation for several hours straight, and it was so awful, that no amount of editing would help. So I decided that a strange robo-AI voiceover would still be better than my rumbles.
So, here it is.
And now, maybe I can add some comments to my videos so they won't be so boring to watch. And, so I can understand what the heck I was thinking about doing those things.
