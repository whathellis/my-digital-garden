# My inner child thinks…?

## Week of 5/28/23 Journal Prompts
 
### "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate." -Carl Jung.
 
Borrowing from one of my favorite Carl Jung quotes, much of our healing work will involve making the unconscious conscious. 
 
This week's journal prompts are an exploratory exercise at taking a deeper look at how we really feel about things that most likely come from our childhood trauma conditioning. 
 
As we start healing and exploring abuse from our family system of origin, we spend a significant amount of time correlating our present behaviors, triggers, and stuck places with our childhood. A common example is realizing we chase unavailable people because our inner child still tries to get an ambivalent parent to be interested or wake up for us.  
 
However, we can only absorb healthier ideas or start new behaviors once we realize where the dysfunctional ones come from. 
 
 
How might your inner child really feel about it? 
 
- Themself as a person
- Sexuality
- Communication
- Love and relationships
- Belonging
- Conflict
- Money, career, purpose, and work-life
- Joy and happiness 
 
In your Gumroad coursework, it is helpful to be familiar with the reparenting your inner child webinar ad become familiar with the dialog tool. Dialoging between our dominant and non-dominant hands is an actionable step to reparenting our inner child. 
 
I've put together an exploratory questionnaire and arranged it into categories. I recommend answering each question with your non-dominant hand; meaning let your inner child answer the following questions and take in what they are saying from your inner adult. 
 
In the space provided, answer the following questions as best you can. If you get stuck on any question, see if you can answer it from your dominant hand.

5. When asked, "Who are you," my inner child thinks-	

>  When children are raised in safety, they are parented around having a sense of self by inclusion, expression, the allowance of autonomy, and healthy feedback. Children who are loved have a sense that they matter to someone, which makes for a good foundation of self.

>  Healthy parents find a way to live outside survival mode or emotional stuckness. They can be present and provide some level of enthusiasm for life. Another Carl Jung quote - "The greatest burden a child must bear is the unlived life of its parents."

This is extremely difficult, but children can often be more attuned to the adult's emotions than their own. Healthy parents distinguish between being real with their children and instilling purpose and hope.
 
## Final Thoughts

.Doctor: These responses were for your own exploration and inquiry. What answers stuck out for you? 
.Doctor: Do you notice any patterns, such as pessimism or anger, throughout the categories? Honor these. They are there for a good reason, but, again, to practice separating the past from the present. What the inner child believes about the issue may still run the stuckness in your present. 
.Doctor:  With answers that are highlighting something for you, explore them more with full dialogues on paper going over any of the following starters of a reparenting conversation
.Patient: Tell me more about that – why does sex feel so bad?
.Patient: I know what you mean. Can you give me some specific examples to connect with where money led to fights?
.Patient: When you say people in love are fake, what happens to the relationship? How might that have been like our family in some way?
.Patient: What did you need from mom about that issue she had with dad and they’d fight?
.Patient: If we changed our mind about love, how do you think we’d feel?
.Patient: If we changed our mind about bringing something up, what do you think that would feel like?
