#### Building the Body Connection
All the women in my family from the mother's side are fat stupid crazy bitches who deserve to be burned alive for their attitude toward me, my father, and grandfather (he is dead, but it's the crazy old bitch who should be in his place).

#### Worksheet 2-2: My Emotional Origins
**Questions About Mother (or other caregiver)**
1. She always want everything to be her way. Also, if she have an opinion about something, no amount of evidence, logical explanations or proves can make her change it, even if the opinion is completely wrong as there facts shows her. She never answers questions those need more than "yes" or "no" and sometimes refuses to say even this one word. If you do something wrong she immideatly explodes. But the strangest thing is that I have never in my life heard or saw her laughing. As well as my dad. 
2. She mostly just yelled, but I did never listened and did everything my way anyway. It was a long time ago, now she realised that I don't care so she yells only on my brother now.
3. When I was little, like about 5 or 7 years old, she sometimes was warm, but not now. And I wouldn't even call it "coldness" it's more like a stone or an empty space.
4. She was supportive in actions, but never in words. And here support lasted as long as it was beneficial for her.
5. I don't think that we really spend much time together since I went to school. There were a period when we all watched movies together in the evening when she comes from work, but it didn't last long. 
6. When I was 11 or 10, her father - my grandfather (I miss him, he was the only adult in our family who liked my father. And I remember watching pirate movies with him. He was a very good person. My mother didn't deserve such a good parent) died. He was a diabetic and had a surgery not too long before that.
7. She always think that she know what I feel, want, need. Even if I tell her otherwise she just don't believe me. I hate those kind of people. This makes me want to cut her neck with the words "see, how much I LOVE you".

**Questions About Father (or other important caregiver)**
1. My father is a good, but very temperamental person. He gets angry as fast as calms down. It's impossible to watch a movie with him bc he would always comment on how stupid everyone is. He is generous and sometimes it looks like he is ready to give me whatever I ask for. So it always astonished me how such a henpecked person can be sexist (not too much, it's just that sometimes he says to my brother something like "and how can someone ever understand a woman"). He hates my mother as much as she hates him, but at least he can admit that he loved the past her, until she shoved her true self. And I am solidar with him in this. He have a good sense of humor.
2. My father never discipline me. If he don't liked what I am doing usually it's because he is to much of a paranoic and worries that something can happen to me, that he is saying ang asks mo to act the other way. And if I refuse we find a way to make him worry less if not don't worry at all.
3. I would say that he is always neutral. He have never been cold to me (except our arguments of course). But usually he gets warm only if he is asking me for something. Though he more often is being cold to my brother.
4. He is always very supportive in everything I do. He likes my drawings, he wanted to pay for courses (even though he couldn't afford it) when I told him that it would be cool to become a tattoo artist (it was not serious), and to take me to Korea when I was learning Korean. He thinks that I'll be able to get where I want to be with my art. 
5. We spend not a lot of time together, but when we do usually we are doing our own stuff and just talking in the process. Also we often talk on the phone.
6. Not after I was born.
7. He is strong and goes to the gym. Also he would die for me. And he thinks that love (not particularly romantic) is the most important thing in life. Also hi believe in crazy alien/aura/soul shit not related to religion (hi is not religious)

**Other Questions About Childhood**
1. Maybe how every holliday I was sitting on a bedside table in my grandmother's bedroom and crying. I can’t even remember any reasonss why I was doing it. 
2. I have a younger brother. And it pisses me off. Not that I have him, but that he gets whatever he wants from mo mother and her mother, while they can't even give me money on a cheapest loaf of bread.
3. I don't remember almost anything except that I was pretty shy, didn't have a lot of friends, but had one best friend  from kindergarten with whom we had a fight or something, so her gramdmother came to me to talk about it. I remember she said that I called my exfriend "fat dough-ball" (lol I was a fatfob even then). But then my friend changed school and we never saw each other again. Also I hated school, but always had good grades.
4. I still was pretty shy, didn't have a lot of friends, but always had a one best friend (in total I had 3-4 ones) with who we had a lot of fun doing "crazy shit". Also even so I didn't care about school, I hated it, most of the time during lessons I was talking to my classmates, drawing in my notebook or reading a book I always had with me, I always had good grades.
5. I went to college. 
6. I don't want to talk about it. 
7. Nothing. And I am pissed off because of that.
