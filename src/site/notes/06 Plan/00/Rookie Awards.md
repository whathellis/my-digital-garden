**Definition of Professional Industry Experience:** Professional industry experience is defined as experience gained by working in a professional environment, such as a studio or agency, as a paid employee or independent contractor, or experience gained by working on projects for clients or customers.

**Related Industry Experience:** Entrants with a maximum of 3 years of professional experience in industries that are similar or related to the contest categories may be considered for eligibility at the discretion of the Rookie Awards team. Related industries are those that involve skills or techniques that are transferable or applicable to the fields of 2D Animation, 3D Animation, Concept Art, Game Development, Visual Effects, Architectural Visualization, Motion Graphics, Immersive Media, Product Design, or Virtual Fashion.

_Example: A professional Graphic Designer with 3 years of experience, but has no 3D Animation industry experience, may be considered for eligibility if our team determines that their skills and experience do not give them an unfair advantage over other entrants._
