#### Will taking this specialization guarantee employment?
While CG Spectrum's advanced students have a high job success rate (83%), we cannot offer guaranteed employment as the film and game industry is competitive, and there is no way of knowing what the market will demand when it comes to animation. 
 
The students who experience the greatest success are those who take responsibility for their careers, put in the hard work to raise their skills to industry standards, leverage their mentor's invaluable expertise, and take advantage of every opportunity to excel. 
 
Taking an advanced 3D animation class not only keeps students focused while they grow as artists and build their portfolios, but it also increases their social scope as they make more contacts with more time and work, a key component in securing a job.  
 
To help students find employment, we have a range of [career services](https://www.cgspectrum.com/career-services) and a dedicated career coach who regularly hosts exclusive career-focused webinars, Q&As, artist interviews, and workshops for CG Spectrum students and graduates and is available to answer career-related questions. 
 
The Specialization course also dedicates a full term to career and industry preparation. With your mentor's guidance, you'll refine your professional portfolio, build essential job skills, and learn how to market yourself. 
 
If you have any questions about our career services as they relate to your personal career goals, please don't hesitate to [get in touch](https://www.cgspectrum.com/contact).

As with any venture, it will be what you make of it! The best animators are constantly growing, evolving, and learning new skill sets.  
 
A specialized 3D animator course is an excellent way to sharpen one’s skills, open doors to exciting new methods and practices, refine your showreel, and continue to grow and network as an artist and member of the animation community. 
 
The benefit of doing the 3D Animator Specialization at CG Spectrum is receiving mentorship from an industry professional who can share their workflows and techniques with you.
