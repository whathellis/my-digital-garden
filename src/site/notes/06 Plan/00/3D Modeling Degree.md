Create 3D assets from scratch as you gain proficiency in software navigation and industry-standard tools while exploring professional workflows. You'll delve into texturing and rendering fundamentals using reference sourcing, UV layout techniques, and various processes and tools for finalizing 3D models with textures and rendering effects.

##### Film and Games Principles, Concepts and Innovations: Learning from History (CCP101)

A firm grasp of the historical foundations, theories, innovations, and principles shaping contemporary practices is vital for film and game artists. This subject uses case studies and documented evidence to delve into the historical, social, technical, and theoretical factors impacting the creative industries. You will analyze how innovations and technologies from one sector (e.g., games) are applied to the other (e.g., film), driving continuous transformation and progress.

##### Industry Overview: Pipeline and Production Processes (ICP101)

3D modelers require a thorough understanding of production pipelines and processes to ensure efficient and timely project development. This subject introduces you to commonly used terminology, frameworks, and stages of these creative fields, emphasizing their interconnectedness. Examine the entire production journey, from inception to distribution, and delve into workflow frameworks unique to animation, VFX, and game studios, facilitating industry comparisons. 

#### Trimester 02

##### Character and Environment Modeling (TCPMOD102)

Create stylized 3D characters and environments, using industry pipeline processes and adhering to sculpting, form, volume, and lighting principles. From initial concept development to sourcing reference imagery and footage, you'll generate a character rig and craft your character in various poses before rendering it in a turntable. You'll also produce polished, pro-level meshes using retopology while becoming proficient in UV layout techniques for applying textures.

##### Art and Design Concepts and Principles (CCP102)

Delve into the theories and principles of color, light, and composition and their relevance in art movements, film, and video games. Analyze compositions and artworks, examining the integration of line, shape, space, depth, content, and style, recognizing their significance in creative endeavors. Through collaborative online discussions, you will get to compare and contrast historical and contemporary artworks, shedding light on the evolution of art and design theories and practices.

##### Communicate! Mode, Purpose and Context (ICP102)

This subject offers a broad overview of professional, ethical, and culturally sensitive communication in both oral and written contexts. Explore the significance of mode, context, and purpose, and investigate communication theories, models, and frameworks for facilitating interactions, transactions, and critiques.
