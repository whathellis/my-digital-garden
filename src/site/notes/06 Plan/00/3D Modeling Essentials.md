**I have nothing but positive things to say about my experience at CG Spectrum.**

I recently finished Introduction to 3D Modeling course. I went in with about a year’s worth of other online 3D modeling courses, but nothing compared to CG Spectrum. I learnt so much from this course, and I had an amazing mentor (Anton Tenitsky) who pushed me to perfection. It was the best decision I made in order to pursue my end goal. I took the next step and enrolled in the advanced course!

Luis M  
**3D Modeling**

**CG Spectrum seemed too good to be true. Looking back, it was the best decision.**

Every mentor and staff member has been so hands-on and directly involved in my learning. Co-Directors of top box office movies and supervisors of major Netflix TV shows are giving me feedback on my projects. Students also have access to a strong community, and an awesome career class to prepare you for your dream job.

Stephanie S  
**3D Modeling**

**You're not just another number.**

I always dreamed of breaking into the entertainment industry and since joining CG Spectrum I realised it's not an unachievable dream. CG Spectrum has a way of mentoring students that I hadn't experienced before. My mentor was always pushing me in order to become industry-ready. Mentors are always available for feedback and take a proactive approach to teaching. Studying online makes for a more dedicated and uninterrupted learning experience.

Stephen C  
**3D Modeling**

**I've just accepted an internship role at Pixar!**

As my final semester of the Advanced 3d Modeling course is coming to an end, I've just accepted an internship role at Pixar! I've learned so much over the past year and am thrilled to have the skills now to make a career change for my dream job. I'm excited to begin this new phase of my journey—thanks so much CG Spectrum!

Michelle V  
**3D Modeling**

**One of the best learning experiences of my life.**

In less than a year I was able to achieve results I could never imagine!

Pietro T  
**3D Modeling**

**The course material covers a lot in a shorter time frame.**

I was really happy with the constructive feedback given to me by my mentor for a 1-on-1 Introduction to 3D Modeling program. The industry tips and workflows recommended helped me get a more robust understanding of workflow fundamentals. I'd recommend CG Spectrum for the calibre of training.
