### FAQs about 3D animation

#### Should I study 2D or 3D animation?

Choosing between 2D and 3D animation comes down to personal preference. 2D animation tends to suit people who are more artistic in nature, whereas 3D animation often suits those with a more technical mind. 
 
2D requires a large amount of illustration, as every frame needs to be drawn, either on a digital tablet or hand drawn. 3D Animation requires creating movement via 'rigs', where a 3D model is essentially given a skeleton that can be manipulated in a virtual 3D space.

#### Can I learn both 2D and 3D animation?

Yes you can. CG Spectrum offers beginner animation courses in both 2D and 3D animation, however it is not recommended to do both at the same time, unless you can dedicate a minimum of 20 hours per week for each course.

#### What 3D animation careers can I explore post graduation?
Learning 3D animation can prepare you for jobs as a

#### Do I need to be good at drawing to be a 3D animator?
No, you don't need to know how to draw to do 3D animation. Many professional 3D animators don't consider themselves particularly good at drawing. What you do need is a strong understanding of the principles of animation and how they can be applied in a three-dimensional environment. You also need to be able to think creatively to come up with original ideas for your animations, and know how to use software like Autodesk Maya to bring your animations to life.

#### Does 3D animation require coding?
No, 3D animation does not require coding.
