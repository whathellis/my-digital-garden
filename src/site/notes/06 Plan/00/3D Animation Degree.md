#### TRIMESTER 01

##### 3D Animation Foundations [[06 Plan/00/3D Animation Foundations\|(TCPANIM101)]]
Dive into the 12 Principles of Animation and learn how to manipulate and animate simple objects using animation rigs. You will explore core animation theories linked to timing, spacing, and overlapping action and practice integrating broader art fundamentals such as silhouettes and dynamic posing to better understand the human figure in 3D space. Move on to more complex animation projects such as walk and run cycles and incorporating props.

##### Film and Games Principles, Concepts and Innovations: Learning from History (CCP101)
A firm grasp of the historical foundations, theories, innovations, and principles shaping contemporary practices is vital for film and game artists. This subject uses case studies and documented evidence to delve into the historical, social, technical, and theoretical factors impacting the creative industries. You will analyze how innovations and technologies from one sector (e.g., games) are applied to the other (e.g., film), driving continuous transformation and progress.

##### Industry Overview: Pipeline and Production Processes (ICP101)
3D animators require a thorough understanding of production pipelines and processes to ensure efficient and timely project development. This subject introduces you to commonly used terminology, frameworks, and stages of these creative fields, emphasizing their interconnectedness. Examine the entire production journey, from inception to distribution, and delve into workflow frameworks unique to animation, VFX, and game studios, facilitating industry comparisons.

#### TRIMESTER 02

##### Body Mechanics (TCPANIM102)
Apply physical laws to animated motion by studying human locomotion during various physical tasks. Beginning with running, jumping, and parkour-style exercises, you will refine your understanding of physiology and the impact of external forces on body movement, including simulating weight as characters interact with different heavy objects. You will also dissect reference footage to create a multi-character animated shot, drawing on core animation principles.

##### Art and Design Concepts and Principles (CCP102)
Delve into the theories and principles of color, light, and composition and their relevance in art movements, film, and video games. Analyze compositions and artworks, examining the integration of line, shape, space, depth, content, and style, recognizing their significance in creative endeavors. Through collaborative online discussions, you will get to compare and contrast historical and contemporary artworks, shedding light on the evolution of art and design theories and practices.

##### Communicate! Mode, Purpose and Context (ICP102)
This subject offers a broad overview of professional, ethical, and culturally sensitive communication in both oral and written contexts. Explore the significance of mode, context, and purpose, and investigate communication theories, models, and frameworks for facilitating interactions, transactions, and critiques. You'll gain insights into paralanguage, responsive listening, active collaboration, and delivering and receiving respectful feedback.

###### Diploma Exit

Students can choose to exit the bachelor's degree after trimester 02 with a diploma or continue their studies through to trimester 06 and earn their bachelor's degree.

#### Trimester 03

##### Storytelling for Animation (TCPANIM201)
Explore character personality and acting principles, including staging, timing, spacing, arcs, and performance, building on previous subject work in motion and physiology. You will analyze acting and human behavior references, creating a pantomime scene and a walk cycle that reflects mental and physiological character traits. You will also delve into animation storytelling techniques, including 'lip-syncing,' where characters are placed in dramatic monologue scenes with recorded dialogue.

##### Concepts and Principles of Story and Visual Narrative (CCP201)
Discover the ways stories are crafted through single, multiple, or moving images. Beginning with the origins of storytelling, you will examine the fundamental concepts and principles that underpin visual storytelling. Literary elements like story arcs, hero's journey, Aristotle's three-act structure, linear and non-linear plots, visual metaphors, motifs, and symbolism are explored, and you'll get to analyze plot structure and character development.

##### Identifying and Solving Problems (ICP201)
In Identifying and Solving Problems, you will tackle everyday challenges with a foundation in theoretically sound problem-solving. Delve into the principles of creative reasoning, encompassing argument presentation and addressing unconscious bias. You will also explore frameworks for analyzing and reviewing artistic works, along with identifying and resolving creative, technical, and ethical issues in creative projects.

#### Trimester 04

##### Advanced Character Acting [[06 Plan/00/3D Animator Specialization#Advanced Character Acting\|(TCPANIM202)]]
Analyze theatre performances and showcase your skills in an animated comedy scene, highlighting comedic timing through physical movements that emphasize character motivation, realistic weight, and timing. Projects involve distinct animation phases, including setup, keying, storytelling poses, breakdowns, in-betweens, and final polish to help build efficient workflows. The subject concludes with a multi-character dialogue scene, integrating camera framing, cuts, and portraying contrasting character personalities and interactions.

##### Concepts and Principles of Lighting and Cinematography (CCP202)
Delve into two essential elements of compelling storytelling in film and games: cinematography and lighting. Cinematography and lighting are used to evoke specific moods or aesthetics; cinematography employs shot framing and camera angles, while lighting uses direction, quality, color, and environment. You will study the theoretical concepts and principles of lighting and cinematography, applying them to visual storytelling and photography in both real-world and digital contexts.

##### Managing Projects and Creative Assets (ICP202)
Realizing and delivering a film or game — on time and within budget — requires strategic thinking and strong organizational skills. Build your knowledge in complex management processes, asset pipelines, and project management systems that streamline the delivery of complex creative projects. You'll also study the processes and tools used to pass digital information through the pipeline, including how assets and shot sequences are managed.

#### Trimester 05

##### Creature Animation [[06 Plan/00/3D Animator Specialization#Creature Animation\|(TCPANIM303)]]
Build an understanding of non-human physiology and shot composition to tackle complex animations. You will explore various rigs, each tailored to a specific animal's motion range, starting with a quadruped. From walking through to running, you will then study typical flight behaviors to create a flight animation that contrasts weightlessness and energy. Wrap up the subject by animating a two-character physical confrontation.

##### Leading with Integrity (ICP302)
This subject delves into self-assessment, team dynamics, conflict management, performance optimization, and effective leadership. With a creative business emphasis, examine ethical, inclusive practices and their impact on the performance of a business.
