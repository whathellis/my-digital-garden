### Thursday, Nov 21
Food diary:
> ```foodiary
> eggs 1
> 9% cottage cheese 490
> ```


Dad finally sent me money and gave me some coffee and a pack of cottage cheese... And I've spent half on the BP and some more just on food. Couldn’t find my fav coconut flover of the energy drink I usually buy, BUT found a new super tasty, just like the grapefruit flover of my second (bc of the higher price) fav one. It's a double win cause I have a collection of cans with each flower (this company makes only sugarfree drinks):

| Binge food | Amount | Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raspberry mini-gingerbreads | 300g | 124$  |      
| Sunflower halva | 510g | 154$ |
| Candies | 325g | 131$ |
| Bread | 350g x 4 | 92$ |
| Soft cheese | 180g | 110$ |
| Condensed milk | 380g | 91$ |
| Waffles | 300g x 2 | 230$ |
| Sunflower toffee candies |     |  |

| Diet food | Amount | Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Eggs | 10 | 150$ |
| Energy drink | 500ml | 150$ |
| 9% cottage cheese | 490g | from dad |

It looks like my mood is OK now. I don't know if it's because I finally BPed properly or drank an energy drink or because when I opened Instagram, there were 137 followers, which means 38 new ones after I posted Brain Threads WIP.

In the evening I was making a new Life Map and Life Value cards in Kinopio.
Also, I looked through the books on [[￼24.11.19\|that]] SD card today and decided to start [[24.11.23\|tomorrow]] some of the psychology [[Intuitive Eating for Every Day by Evelyn Tribole\|workbooks]] I found. The only sad thing is that most of them are .epab.

Some weeks ago, I asked a non-ED-related question on MPA and got a lot of interesting answers, but I updated it today because I realized that it wasn't really clear what I was trying to ask.
Here they are:

.Nonbinary and trans people I have a question:
I am sorry in advance if I sound rude, use the wrong pronouns, or anything else. I really don't have anything against you and think that everyone should do whatever (literally) they want.  
.Nonbinary and trans people I have a question:
But I was always interested isn't it quite sexist?  
Wait, wait, let me explain:  
For example: there is a biological boy and he likes wearing makeup and dresses, and I think it's totally OK. But then, He wants everyone to call him She/Her. Doesn't that imply that only girls can wear makeup and dresses and stuff? So, isn't it sexist?  
.Nonbinary and trans people I have a question:
I am sorry if my question is stupid and it's just me getting everything wrong.  
But please explain, I really don't understand.  
.Nonbinary and trans people I have a question:
**Updated**: Stypid me just reread what I have written and realized that it's not clear what I am trying to ask.  
So for clearification: 
1, I don't think that being trans or nonbinary is sexist.  
2. I think men wearing dresses is as okay as women wearing dresses.  
3. **My point was not about the person's appearance but about the pronouns they use.**  
4. So the question I have is isn't it sexist for a biological man who wears dresses to call himself "she/her" just because he likes to wear dresses and otherwise for women?  
4.1. I am oversimplifying here, I know that it's not "_just because he likes to wear dresses_", but why not just wear dresses, makeup etc. AND still call themself "he/him" and not "they/them/she/her/etc." and otherwise for women?

. Skinnyfatballs:
I'm not nonbinary or trans just a just a fellow queer (lesbian),  
. Skinnyfatballs:
I don't think it's sexist in the slightest, more gender fluid if that makes sense. I don't understand why things have to be for that one sex why can't a "boy" wear a dress when a "girl" can wear a suit if she pleases. It doesn't matter what you identify with you can wear makeup to express yourself its not strictly for one gender. Self expression and acceptance of one's true self to the point where they feel comfortable to be themselves in this world.  
. Skinnyfatballs:
For nonbinary and trans people I would explain it a bit like this.... How do you know you're a man or woman? Try and explain it without using genitalia, assigned gender at birth, or stereotypes or anything that pushed by the process of socialisation. They just know thats who they are. It's an inner truth that they can comminunicate through self expression.  
. Skinnyfatballs:
Disclaimer; I hope I haven't offended anyone by not explaining thoroughly or you know not having had these experiences. So feel free to educate/correct me

i don’t understand what your question is.  
. nebulous lynx:
not all boys that play with dolls are trans, in fact most of them aren’t?  
. nebulous lynx:
maybe you can explain a bit more what you mean?

.mourning:
It may be that since we are born, based on our gender assigned at birth we are expected to do or like certain things and even behave in a way  
.mourning:
For example in my case, I was never into make up or accesories. My mom would try to introduce me to nail polish. I've had my nails done a couple of times before feeling like I shouldn't do this. It's the association most likely (currently I'm considering painting them black lol). Like "girls do this, I'm doing this and I don't vibe with being one so I should stop"  
.mourning:
I don't know if I explained myself well, but it's like looking through a window witnessing other people living my desired type of childhood. I wasn't able to experience boyhood so I just tried to cope by refusing everything feminine on me. Yes, I was an "not like the other girls" until my egg cracked  
.mourning:
Now I don't feel veryvaffected by stereotypes and it's FREEING
.mourning.:
16 - Non-binary guy (yes, it's possible) - Height: 163cm - HW/SW: 59kg - CW: fluctuating 53-54kg - LW: 49kg  
I spend a lot of time here I think  
I slightly give second-hand embarrassment.​

(im nonbinary, but im not a Gender Expert, so please lmk if i say something that's wrong or something that's only a piece of a bigger picture)  
.greetingsfromjupiter:
it wouldn't rlly be sexist because that person wouldn't be forcing gender norms/stereotypes on OTHER people. there are a variety of factors that go into a trans person's expression and while gender norms might play a part, that's not the whole picture.  
.greetingsfromjupiter:
trans people live in the same world as cis people, which means many trans people grow up with some idea of gender norms. a child can grow up in an extremely progressive home and STILL operate through gender norms bc these norms are a fundamental part of a lot of cultures.  
.greetingsfromjupiter:
to use the example in ur post, a transfemme person might wear dresses and makeup simply because they like it, but they could also be worried about "passing" and don't want to wear clothes that are considered masculine for the fear that people will tell they're trans. even tho this person is operating on gender norms ("girls wear dresses, i will wear a dress to look like a girl") that doesn't mean they truly believe in these gender norms and, like i said, it wouldn't be sexist of them because they're not imposing gender stereotypes onto others  
.greetingsfromjupiter:
gender is complicated in general, but it's especially complicated for trans people. a trans person's gender expression/identity can be incredibly complex so i understand why some people are confused about how trans people feel internally and live their lives. if u wanna know more about how life is for trans folks, there's plenty of trans youtubers that can explain a lot. Sam Collins, Samantha Lux, Kat Blaque, and Lily Alexandre make lots of vids about being trans + their personal experiences with being trans and they're incredibly informative as well as entertaining!

.Deaddeadinthebed:
Being trans doesnt mean you just fit with the stereotypes of a different gender than what you were assigned at birth. A lot of trans people (but not all) will have social and or physical dysphoria, which is basically a feeling of incongruence between how you feel you should be and how you are or are seen. Lots of trans people don't match the sterotypes of their real gender, there are feminine trans men and masculine trans women just like there are cis people who dont fit gender norms but are still cis. The difference is basically in how the person sees themselves and how they want to navigate the world so other people see them as they are internally.

Trans man here.  
I transition cause I have dysphoria which is a medical condition. It takes a huge tool on my mental health. Not having male primary and secondary sex characteristics is making me suicidal.  
It's not about gender norms.  
I like having long hair. I enjoy painting my nails.  
It's my body that is mismatched. I'm not transitioning because I like male gender roles better. It's quite the opposite actually. Well other than muscles. Those are hot. Lol.

Thanks! Also, sorry, I just realized my question wasn't clear enough and I had a typo in "pronouns" which was the point of my question.  
Your answer really helped me to see my dumbness😅. Idk why I haven't thought about it myself.  
And thanks for the youtube recommendations, I definitely need to check them out.
